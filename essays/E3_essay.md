## E3: Preparing for WODs Technical Essay

**For Browser 6** the task was to make the different browser sections into their own page in a navigation bar. Also, we were supposed to show the picture of the specific browser when someone hover over the browser. **For SmartPhoneProducts1** the task was to use variables to create the product, price, and image for the code to work from a different .js file. **For Invoice 1** the task was to create a sales receipt or invoice with five products, in a table, with a subtotal, and taxes. **For Invoice 2** the task was to use a loop to generate a table and to add a shipping by checking conditional expressions. **For SmartPhoneProducts2** the task was to use variables to make the products more accessible.  Finally, **for SmartPhoneProducts3** the task was to use an array made of objects to display the phone in the table. 

**Browser 6** was simple but was a lot of busy work. It was a lot of replacing code with different tags. I guess this is the life of a developer, lots of find and replace. Making the sections into their own page was easy and did not take a long time. What gave me some problems, was trying to get the event listeners to work, but not because I did not know what was happening in the code, but because the browser was acting up. Therefore, the and screencast is long. I ended the assignment with a Sd for my final time. 

**SmartPhoneProducts1** I also finished with a Sd for my final time. This was because it was even more find and replace things to change them into variables. Part of it was my fault, for not knowing how Vs. Code’s find and replace worked. I am happy because I think I got the hang of it now. That will save me a lot of time. That said, the assignment was easy and if wasn’t for the time-consuming tag changes, that I had to do manually, I would probably get an average time in the lower part of the range. It was great to work with a source file that was not embedded in the HTML and use those variables. 

**Invoice 1** was a fun assignment. It was great to create the expressions using operators. Again, there was some copy and paste but not so bad. Though, I am seeing a pattern here, and if someone wants to be a developer, this is just part of coding. The expressions, like I mentioned before, were straight forward and easy to manipulate to get them to do the calculations. It was easy to create the variable necessary to calculate sub-total and taxes as well. What slowed me down to a holt, it was to try to create a table and use the template string at the same time. It took me a while to understand how they worked together. For Invoice 1, I did run out of time, so I did twice. The reason is because the first time I try to use Mr. Port’s way of doing the table, but I got confused and that did not work well for me. The better way, for me, was to see the page source and copy the table and use that one instead. 

**Invoice 2** also was a fun and challenging assignment. Loops are tricky, checking the conditions making sure it will run as many times as it needs to run, seems simple but when I am coding it is not simple at all. This assignment I did twice, but it was for curios reasons. I play around changing the loop as well as changing the variables to see the results. But over all and easy and simple assignment to understand. 

**SmartPhoneProducts2** I started the WOD confident because I knew the material well. I had played around with loops on the previous assignment, and I was ready. To be honest, I coasted to the first instructions, which was to make the loops and create the product table. These was my fastest assignment and I finished with a Rx time. 

**SmartPhoneProducts3** was a very clean screencast. I think that I am starting to develop a system that works to do the recording. Either that, or the instructions were clearer. I guess, I also understood arrays and objects well, so that help me a lot for developing the code. I was confident, and most important, I was happy to be coding. When things work the way, you intend them to work it is like dominos falling, they just fall into place one after another. I know this felling doesn’t last long because on the very next lab it went away. I am not looking forward to doing the functions WODs.

**To conclude**, I think I did well overall. I learned form my mistakes from the previous WODs. As an example, I did not look at the time clock. I just concentrated on the task at hand. A big plus, it was that when I ran out of time, on the first attempt, I did not get frustrated. I restart the recorder and start it again. I think a big improvement for these WODs was that I read the instructions many times before I started. I knew what I had to do, so I was not reading every line. And once I understood how the string template worked, I finished the WODs in a more manageable time. Looking to the future, I would like to make sure that I am learning, that it does not matter the time or if things don’t work. I should just take my time and learn what the process needs, learn what is that I am doing. In other words, when I know the concept things run smoothly. When I kind of know, I force the code, get frustrated and most detrimental of all, I don’t learn. So, the most important thing I need to do for future WODs is to take my time and learn the subject that is part of the task.
