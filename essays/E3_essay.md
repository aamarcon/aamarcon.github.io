**For this WOD** we were supposed to create a sales receipt or invoice with five products, in a table, with a subtotal, and taxes. Also, as part of the assignment, we were supposed to comment our code. The assignment covers the expressions and operatorsâ€™ part of the modules. We were also supposed to change the value of the variable to test and see if our code worked dynamically.  The expressions and operators were not very difficult understand the difficulty was on the string template. 

**I started the WOD** confident because I knew the material well. To be honest, I coasted to the first instructions, which was to make comments and create the product data. The expressions like I mentioned before, were straight forward and easy to manipulate to do the calculations. It was easy to create the variable necessary to calculate sub-total and taxes as well. What slowed me down to a holt, it was to try to create a table and use the template string at the same time. It took me a while to understand how they worked together. I ran out of time, and I had to start again. 

**To conclude**, I think I did well overall. I learned form my mistakes from the previous WODs. As an example, I did not look at the time clock. I just concentrated on the task at hand. A big plus, it was that when I ran out of time, the first attempt, I did not get frustrated. I restart the recorder and start it again. I think a big improvement for this WOD was that I read the instructions many times before I started. I knew what I had to do, so I was not reading every line. And once I understood how the string template worked, I finished the WOD in average time.
