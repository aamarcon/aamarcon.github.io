<p><strong>My programming skills</strong> have improved at least in three major ways. The first, and maybe one of the most important, if not the most important, by thinking more critically even before the first line of code, making it easier to build good code. In other words, improving the planning of what the program will do has helped me be a better programmer. Secondly, and keeping up with the first point here, using code comments helped me improve my programming immensely. I am able to follow the flow of my code by just looking at the comment above. Granted, this does not happen all the time, but it was an improvement. And the third one, is debugging. I am much better at spotting things that are not working properly. I realized that taking a break and walking away from the code for a few minutes and sometimes even longer, can be beneficial and maybe even help find the bug in about the same time that would take to be persisting on the problem, and it is less frustrating.</p>

<p><strong>I still get frustrated</strong>. I think the one thing I could improve is the last point on the above paragraph. Sometimes when I cannot find the bug, I will go for hours without a break, or eating. I will catch myself doing the same thing and expecting a different result, which is the definition of insanity by the way. This is something I must improve if I want to keep programming. Although it is easier said than done, at least in my case.</p>

<p><strong>I think the only reason</strong> I have learned from the WOD’s is because I never looked at the screencast. Also, the same reason I got super frustrated as well. Solving the problem by going online and really being a programmer is by far the best way to do the WOD’s and become better at it. The part that I did not understand and was not a fan of was to record a screencast and time myself. It might me a Mr. Miyagi kind of thing, I just did not get it.</p>

<p><strong>Also</strong>, the labs helped on the growing process of me becoming a programmer. They were very helpful to understand certain concepts and they really helped with assignment one. That said, the labs need a complete revision of the material. The grammar, punctuation, and even some of the code need to be revised. It is hard, frustrating, and counterproductive to find so many typos on an assignment. It is difficult to try to learn something when you are also trying to figure out what is asked of you.</p>

<p><strong>Assignment one</strong> was a difficult assignment. I have to say that the labs and the WOD’s really prepared us for the assignment but conversely, it is a lot of material that come together at the same time. And although I can say that I feel ready to start assignment number two, getting feedback on the assignment one code would be helpful. Furthermore, maybe going over some of the concepts that were given to us on the labs, in the form of code, would also be helpful.</p>

<p><strong>I already mentioned</strong> some of the ways that the class could be improved, but I will call attention to the material once again, especially the labs. It definitely has to be revised. I also think that the material uses jargon of programmers. And even though I understand that this is the material we have to learn and should start learning some of the language, it should be offered with more detailed explanation. After all, there is no prerequisite for this class.</p>

<p><strong>What helped me the most</strong> in this class was the professor. I am sure that he did his best and shared his time not only with myself, but also everyone in the class. This one-on-one time is worth much more than many labs. What helps me is to understand the concept. To expand on this, in programming you can see or copy something, change a little, and make it work, but that does not have any value in the real world. Taking the time to explain in a way that a copy becomes unnecessary is the best way to create programmers. These are very complex things to teach and even harder to comprehend, and though it does require repetition in order to improve, it is a billion times more rewarding when the whole concept can be grasped. A double loop is a perfect example to explain what I am trying to say here. You can see the code, name it ‘i’ and ’j’, or column and rows and still make it work but not understand the concept. Now when you understand the concept of a double loop and the shapes and designs that are possible to be created, it is much more rewarding and advantageous.</p>
