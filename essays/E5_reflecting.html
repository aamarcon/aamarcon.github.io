<p><strong>For assignment 2</strong> we were supposed to add more futures to assignment one. A big part of the assignment was to allowed multiple users to log in, and if they were not in the log in catalog, to make them register. The other part was to make some security to the side. As an example, if you were not logged in you werenâ€™t supposed to see the invoice page. And finally, there were supposed to be some personalization to the site, so when someone logged in or register their name should appear.</p>

<p><strong>For this assignment</strong> I learned much more about how GET and POST works. I learned the hard way how the server and client have to exchange information via query strings. I think not so much learning but adding to the understanding of how objects work. There was a lot of suffering trying to learn how to pass parameters from different parts of the server and client.</p>

<p><strong>For this project</strong> I worked by myself. Therefore, I contributed 100% to the assignment. It was good to take this project by myself. It is hard to think about every little detail that there is in the assignment document and code at the same time. But after this assignment I came up with some new approaches that I think may help in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Getting help</strong> for me is always a struggle. I think that for some reason I know how to fix it a problem and I will lose hours and days trying to solve on my own before reaching out for help. When I reached out for help was via emails to professor Kazman. I think for the question, what did I need help with? Is a hard one to answer. That is the problem, I guess. Sometimes, it is so hard to know what is wrong and is hard to formulate how to ask a question online or via text, in other words it is hard to express what the problem is. I think that is something I must learn how to do.</p>

<p><strong>Developing assignment 2</strong> was different in two ways. One, it was more complicated to understand the pathways that were needed because of the extra level of security. And two, dealing with server side is hard. I think we just learned a little bit of server side and we had to jump on the deep end of the server pool right away.</p>

<p><strong>As to the question,</strong> estimate the % of time you spent thinking about how to do something, writing code but do not include testing, and testing and debugging. I think it is like forty percent thinking, twenty writing and another forty debugging. The part of writing code might be even less. Once I have the code thought out, it is very simple to write. The thinking though, is a whole other thing. If you count the subconscious thoughts during sleep, the percentage might be much higher for thinking. How many times I woke up in the middle of the night with the solution to the code problem that I went to sleep thinking about it? The answer is many. That unknown amount of time might end up making writing and debugging only 10% if not even less. Though with my original answer of forty thinking, twenty writing, forty debugging, I think that I am getting better at debugging and getting better a debugging requires more thinking.</p>

<p><strong>What worked well</strong> was the process that I created to do the project. I recognize that it can get to a point when I am not productive anymore. I should just walk away, and let the subconscious do its thing and find the answer. The better rested I am, I noticed that the coding runs smoothly. That said though, I ran out of time. I did not manage my time well and at the end had to push through many hours without a break. When I am doing ten to twelve hours of coding my eyes get tired and that makes the brain want to stop. Having a balance between rest and time management of the project is key.</p>

<p><strong>I think if I could do things differently,</strong> I would have done it a workflow chart of what is needed for the assignment. I also, would break each part of the workflow to workflows of that particular section and approach the assignment part by part. I am realizing that this is the case for coding. Sometimes I just see the whole entire problem being solved piece by piece in my head. So, I think I have an overview of the whole thing. But when I start coding and I run into a problem the view disappears from my head and is back to square one. A flowchart will be the new norm, though that is easier said than done.</p>
