## My Strategy
For Browser History One, my strategy was to read the instructions well. I have done a little bit of HTML and CSS a long time ago and I thought that the assignment would be a piece of cake. After reading the instructions, I was confident that I was going to be able to finish in a decent time on the very first try. Well, I was wrong. First, getting the set up to do the WODs was complicating. I knew that when you press shift, command, and five together on a Mac, it turns on a recorder to screencast. I run a test, but I could not get the microphone to work. So, I took the recommendation of the assignment and downloaded a new software, the OBS studio app. After playing with it for a while, I was able to understand how it worked well enough to start my first casting.

## What Happaned When the Strategy Did Not Work
It did not take long for me to notice that it was going to be impossible to finish the screencast in fifteen minutes or less. I did not prepare the links that I had to open ahead of time and sometimes when I have many windows open in my browser, things are slow to load. I also noticed that I was worried about the clock and between looking at the clock and trying to look back at the task that I was supposed to do, I was losing time and focus. When it got to twenty minutes I stopped.

## How I Felt
I felt frustrated, I felt that they were simple tasks and that I should’ve being able to do it at least at an average level. Though I did not feel well about myself, I knew I could at least do the assignment. 
## Love When a Plan Works 
This time, I planned better by doing the following. I opened the links that I was going to need in different windows, I told myself that I was not going to look at the stopwatch until I was done, I was going to read the entire question before starting the task, and I was just going to try to do my best in whatever time it took to get it done. 
Well, though that was a good plan, I finished the second try in about thirty-two minutes. This time I was also frustrated, but it was not because of the time or the code itself, it was because I knew I had to do it again. I noticed that reading the question out loud was taking too much of my time, and that by now I knew what was asked of me. So, I set up to do the assignment for the third time. This time I finished on time. It was not the best time because it was in the range of the Sd, but I finished. So, I can say: “I love when a plan works”.
