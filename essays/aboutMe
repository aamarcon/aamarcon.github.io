*Aloha everyone,*

My name is Alexandre Marcondes. I recently finished my associates degree in Liberal Arts Business at Kapiolani Community College. This is my first year at Shidler School of Business at Manoa. I am excited to have added a Management in Information Systems to my Accounting major. I am enjoying learning all these new technologies. I believe that by having both degrees I will be a more marketable employee in the near future. Looking forward to the challenges that this class will bring. I am also available to help any of my peers in this class, feel free to reach out for help or just chat.
