## E3: Reflecting on Assignment 3

**Briefly describe your system?**
We are a fish store. We have tanks, plants for the tanks and betta fish. We have a starting fish tank kit, for the beginner, all the way up to thousands of dollars thank. 

**Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?**
One shortcoming is that the nav-bar to the admin page does not collapse the same way of the regular site. 
This was due to time, I wanted to make functional first, and because we did it on the regular site it shows we can do it.
We were very diligent in trying to resolve all the bugs we encounter and I think we have a super cool and functional store.
We wanted to implement all the IRs to get lot's of extra credit and though we did many more than assigned, we did not get to do all of them.  

**Describe what you are most proud of about your system:**
The navigation bar collapsing for all types of screens, app like. The overall feel and easiness to navigate. It is user friendly. 
When you are on the site you are the driver but if you run into a problem the software guides you to an answer. 

**Describe what you are least happy with your system:**
I don't like that the email is send from a phony store, but that is the only way the school server 
Recognize to send the email. 

**How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?**
The major change from assignment 2 to this assignment is how much better I got at debugging. I guess with more coding knowledge, it is much easier to find out where things are going wrong. It was also different working in a group. It was nice to see how
other people solve a problem. 

**When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?**
Console.log is my number one go to tool to address any problem. If I want to find out if I got to a function, I console.log "I am here inside the function name". If I don't know the data type I am receiving console.log(typeof) to the rescue. This became a great tool in addressing issues. 

**Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?**
Working with a partner was great to solve problems. When one person was stuck the other would have a different idea so the project did not haul to a stop, like when working on our own. 
I think that we worked well together and that worked well for the project. Bouncing ideas to make things work in different ways than our own is challenging and rewarding at the same time. I learned from the other person a complete different way of doing something that I would have done it differently.  

**Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?**
Whenever there was a simultaneous push and pull we ran into some problems. Because we were reading and writing to the file, the push and pull on GitHub would bug out. That was something that did not work well, and we spent time debugging this instead of code.

**What did you learn from doing this assignment?**
This assignment really gave a in depth look at sessions and cookies. I also, learned how to keep track of the redirects and how to 
keep track of all the Gets and Posts. It was good to see CSS form Bootstrap and use their tools. 


**If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?**
I would draw things down more, make work flows. Think about the code more and try to debug less. Before starting writing code take the time
to know what exactly I want to do and then start writing code.  

**Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging**
20% thinking about how to do something and I think this is something I have to improve on. I need to think about 40% to debug less. I think writing code was just 30% and debugging the other 50%. When things break debugging is just a process of one thing at a time and that takes time. 

**Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)**

Over all, we tried to problem solve together and worked together as many times it was possible.
We tried to split the project equaly between all of us. That said, I think that 
Bobby would stay after the meeting and push through to find a solution for a specific problem
Therefore I would give Bobby 40% of the project. As for myself I spend many hours outside the 
Meeting problem solving and creating parts of the project I would say that 35% of the assignment was cover by me.
The other 25% was cover by Eva. She was in the meeting and did the parts that was asked of her but it is my feeling that
she did not go beyond as much as Bobby and I. I think that 33.3% is unrealistic to say that the project was like that, but I am proud that everyone put their best effort forward and I am proud of my group and the project.
